# CS-300


What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Project One was about analyzing run-time and memory tradeoffs of different data structures.
Project Two was implementing a program that loads course data and sorts/prints the courses in alphanumeric order. 
Both focused on applying data structure knowledge to practical programming tasks. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I compared how each data structure worked under different conditions, those chose the one that seemed the most appropriate.
Understanding data structures is important because the wrong choice can make code inefficient, waste resources and/or become unmanagable as the dataset grows. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The biggest roadblock I hit wasn’t with the logic itself but with running the program. Since I was building from scratch, I expected a signifigant amount of testing, especially for the simple stuff that will likely need multiple small tweaks back to back, like building/testing the menu loop while it only prints FIXME statements. To accomodate for this, I installed an extension for VS Code that was supposed to allow me to run the .cpp from the console like the heavyweight IDEs. I spent hours fighting with the console before deciding I wasted enough time. I decided all tests were just going to get ran by compiling into an .exe and running it. I donned ol' faithful, Git Bash, and typed "g++ ProjectTwo.cpp -o p2" many, many times, but I was building and testing everything consistently. That switch let me focus on the actual project instead of the toolchain, which was a good reminder to adjust my approach instead of forcing a setup that isn’t working, or just not to try and change a major technique on game day. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
While I still defaulted to a vector, I've have a signifigantly more amount of experience evaluating other data structures. Specifally, a better ability to think about not only how a data structure is going to be used, but how the data structure uses itself. 


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I've always put effort in making my programs in a fashion that Uncle Bob would call "Clean Code". I don't think this project specifically had a drastic impact, but it was a phenomonal chuck of XP building it from scratch. There's been a lot of projects in recent courses that were "here's broken code, fix it", it was actually refreshing to get to make the whole baby.
